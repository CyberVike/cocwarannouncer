# Discord Clash of Clans War Details

A node.js discord bot written to monitor the Clash of Clans API and announce war attacks to a discord channel. It will also announce when prep day has started and when war day begins. There is also a reminder message 1 hour before war ends. Also by default there is a final message that pings `@everyone` 15 minutes, by default, before war ends to get their war attacks in if they haven't. All messages are configrable withom the config file as well as the final minutes timer that pings `@everyone`.
